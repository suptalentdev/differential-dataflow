//! An append-only collection of update batches.
//!
//! The `Spine` is a general-purpose trace implementation based on collection and merging
//! immutable batches of updates. It is generic with respect to the batch type, and can be
//! instantiated for any implementor of `trace::Batch`.
//!
//! ## Design
//!
//! This spine is represented as a list of layers, where each element in the list is either
//!
//!   1. MergeState::Vacant  empty
//!   2. MergeState::Single  a single batch
//!   3. MergeState::Double  a pair of batches
//!
//! Each "batch" has the option to be `None`, indicating a non-batch that nonetheless acts
//! as a number of updates proportionate to the level at which it exists (for bookkeeping).
//!
//! Each of the batches at layer i contains at most 2^i elements. The sequence of batches
//! should have the upper bound of one match the lower bound of the next. Batches may be
//! logically empty, with matching upper and lower bounds, as a bookkeeping mechanism.
//!
//! Each batch at layer i is treated as if it contains exactly 2^i elements, even though it
//! may actually contain fewer elements. This allows us to decouple the physical representation
//! from logical amounts of effort invested in each batch. It allows us to begin compaction and
//! to reduce the number of updates, without compromising our ability to continue to move
//! updates along the spine. We are explicitly making the trade-off that while some batches
//! might compact at lower levels, we want to treat them as if they contained their full set of
//! updates for accounting reasons (to apply work to higher levels).
//!
//! We maintain the invariant that for any in-progress merge at level k there should be fewer
//! than 2^k records at levels lower than k. That is, even if we were to apply an unbounded
//! amount of effort to those records, we would not have enough records to prompt a merge into
//! the in-progress merge. Ideally, we maintain the extended invariant that for any in-progress
//! merge at level k, the remaining effort required (number of records minus applied effort) is
//! less than the number of records that would need to be added to reach 2^k records in layers
//! below.
//!
//! ## Mathematics
//!
//! When a merge is initiated, there should be a non-negative *deficit* of updates before the layers
//! below could plausibly produce a new batch for the currently merging layer. We must determine a
//! factor of proportionality, so that newly arrived updates provide at least that amount of "fuel"
//! towards the merging layer, so that the merge completes before lower levels invade.
//!
//! ### Deficit:
//!
//! A new merge is initiated only in response to the completion of a prior merge, or the introduction
//! of new records from outside. The latter case is special, and will maintain our invariant trivially,
//! so we will focus on the former case.
//!
//! When a merge at level k completes, assuming we have maintained our invariant then there should be
//! fewer than 2^k records at lower levels. The newly created merge at level k+1 will require up to
//! 2^k+2 units of work, and should not expect a new batch until strictly more than 2^k records are
//! added. This means that a factor of proportionality of four should be sufficient to ensure that
//! the merge completes before a new merge is initiated.
//!
//! When new records get introduced, we will need to roll up any batches at lower levels, which we
//! treat as the introduction of records. Each of these virtual records introduced should either be
//! accounted for the fuel it should contribute, as it results in the promotion of batches closer to
//! in-progress merges.
//!
//! ### Fuel sharing
//!
//! We like the idea of applying fuel preferentially to merges at *lower* levels, under the idea that
//! they are easier to complete, and we benefit from fewer total merges in progress. This does delay
//! the completion of merges at higher levels, and may not obviously be a total win. If we choose to
//! do this, we should make sure that we correctly account for completed merges at low layers: they
//! should still extract fuel from new updates even though they have completed, at least until they
//! have paid back any "debt" to higher layers by continuing to provide fuel as updates arrive.
